The World Health Organisation sends out new guidelines. The guidelines are for children’s parents.
The guidelines say what many parents already know.
The guidelines say that children should move more. They should sit less. Children should get enough sleep.
Children between 1 to 4 years old should move three hours a day or more.
Babies younger than 1 year old should move some times of the day, too.
Children between 2 to 4 years old should not watch an electronic screen for more than one hour a day.
Children younger than 2 years old should not look at electronic screens at all.
Difficult words: guideline (a rule to help you know what to do), should (if you should do something, it is good to do it),
electronic screen (the ‘window’ into a computer/tablet/phone).
You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.
