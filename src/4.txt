Do you want to get the maximum benefit from the game? In today’s article, we show you how to do it.
Go to www.robinsoninlevels.com and start playing.
In the Story part of each chapter, try to understand each sentence.
If you don’t understand the sentence, click on the help line for translation.
You can also click on the help line after you choose the correct word.
The translation shows for only 1.5 seconds, but it can help you understand the story better.
Complete the Test part, then go to the Listening part.
The Listening part is optional but important if you want to get the maximum benefit.
In the Listening part, do these steps.
Listen and read.
Hide the translation on the right. Listen and read again without help.
Hide the text on the left and try to understand without reading.
Hide the text on the left and try to translate the text back into the language which you are learning. If you are not sure, open the left side for help.
Practice, practice, practice! Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you can translate perfectly.
We wish you great success!
