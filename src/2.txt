Drake is angry with Kendrick Lamar and some music companies.
Lamar’s song Not Like Us says bad things about Drake. The song calls him a sex offender.
Both rappers sing songs against each other.
This song makes their fight worse. This week, Drake sends papers to courts in Texas and New York.
He says that Universal Music, Spotify, and iHeartMedia use tricks to make the song popular.
He believes that they use bots. They pay people to make the song popular.
Universal says that this is not true. Spotify and iHeartMedia say nothing.
Drake’s company, Frozen Moments, also complains about the song.
Difficult words: sex offender (a person who does something bad and it involves sex),
bot (a computer program which acts like a real person), complain (to say that something is wrong).
You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.
