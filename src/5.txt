Scientists in the Philippines make new rice.
This rice is good for people with diabetes.
This rice has less sugar and more protein.
Scientists work ten years to make it.
It could help people in Asia, where many people eat rice.
Experts say that this rice alone will not stop diabetes.
The problem is the sugary foods and drinks that many people eat.
Too much sugar can cause diabetes and obesity.
Scientists hope that the new rice will help. But people also need to eat healthy food and live a healthy life.
Difficult words: diabetes (a disease where blood sugar is too high),
